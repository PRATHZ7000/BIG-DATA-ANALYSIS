# Big Data Analysis Project - Task 1

## Overview

This repository contains the solution for **Task 1 of Big Data Analysis**, implemented in Python. The objective of this task is to perform data preprocessing, aggregation, and insightful analysis on a given dataset using fundamental data manipulation techniques.

The task was carried out using **Google Colab**, which provides a cloud-based Python environment with easy access to essential libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`. The primary dataset was downloaded from **Kaggle** and analyzed to extract meaningful patterns and summaries.

## File Structure

- `prathamesh_murkute_task_1_big_data_analysis_.py`: The main Python script which performs all data operations.
- `README.md`: Documentation of the project including description, usage, and outputs.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Specifically:

- **Dataset Name**: *TripAdvisor Hotel Reviews Dataset*
- **Description**: This dataset contains hotel reviews along with sentiment labels that indicate the polarity of the text. It's commonly used for sentiment analysis and NLP-based classification tasks.

## Key Features

- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Reads CSV data, handles missing values, and renames columns for clarity.
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: Includes descriptive statistics, data types, and null value checks.
- **Aggregation and Grouping**: Performs group-by operations to summarize data based on relevant attributes.
- **Visualization**: (If implemented) generates plots to visualize trends, distributions, or categorical breakdowns.
- **Insight Generation**: Identifies patterns in reviews and ratings to support decision-making.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Google Colab** (for development and execution)
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib` (if visualization is included)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
Open the .py script in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.

Upload the TripAdvisor dataset (tripadvisor_hotel_reviews.csv) if not already available.

Run all cells to view the analysis and results.

#Output

The output includes:

Cleaned dataset summary

Sentiment distribution counts

Aggregated statistics (e.g., average length of reviews, frequency of sentiments)

Any additional insights derived from the data
